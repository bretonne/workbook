# Exercise 10:Arithmetic
# # (Solved—20 Lines)
# # Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user.Your program should
# # compute and display:
# # • The sum of a and b
# # • The difference when b is subtracted from a
# # • The product of a and b
a = int(input("a:"))
b = int(input("b:"))
print("Sum of {0} and {1} is {2}".format(a, b, a+b))
print("a-b={0}".format(a-b))
print("a*b={0}".format(a*b))
