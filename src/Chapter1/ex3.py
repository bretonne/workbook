# Exercise 3:Area of a Room
# (Solvedâ€”13 Lines)
# Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once
# the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the
# room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include
# units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which
# unit you are more comfortable working with.
len_input = input("Length:")
length = int(len_input)
wid_input = input("width:")
width = int(wid_input)
area = length*width
print("The area of the room is {0} square meters".format(area))
