# Exercise 128: Reverse Lookup
# (Solvedâ€”40 Lines)
# Write a function named reverseLookup that finds all of the keys in a dictionary
# that map to a specific value. The function will take the dictionary and the value to
# search for as its only parameters. It will return a (possibly empty) list of keys from
# the dictionary that map to the provided value.
# Include a main program that demonstrates the reverseLookup function as part
# of your solution to this exercise. Your program should create a dictionary and then
# show that the reverseLookup function works correctly when it returns multiple
# keys, a single key, and no keys. Ensure that your main program only runs when
# the file containing your solution to this exercise has not been imported into another
# program.
