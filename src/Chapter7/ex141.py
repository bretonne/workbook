# Exercise 141: Display the Head of a File
# (Solvedâ€”40 Lines)
# Unix-based operating systems usually include a tool named head. It displays the
# first 10 lines of a file whose name is provided as a command line parameter. Write
# a Python program that provides the same behavior. Display an appropriate error
# message if the file requested by the user does not exist or if the command line
# parameter is omitted.
